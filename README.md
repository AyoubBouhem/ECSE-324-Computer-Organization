# ECSE-324
This repositories contains the code written for the labs of the class ECSE 324 - Computer Organization at McGill University, Winter 2018. The lab were completed with ARM assembly subroutines and C programs.

All labs were completed with the use of Quartus 16.1 and Intel FPGA monitor program on an Altera DE1-SoC single board computer.

Lab 1:
This lab required us to implement bubble sort in assembly.

Lab 2:
The first part of this lab required us to implement a way to computer a fibonacci sequence recursively using assembly and the second part of this lab taught us to call assembly subroutine from a C program.

Lab 3:
This lab introduced us to Drivers development of the I/O of the DE1-SoC computer such the slider switches, push buttons and 7-segment displays. The first part required us to program drivers for the display logic on the 7 segments. The second part of the lab required us to implement a timer using polling logic for the buttons and using interrupts for the buttons. 

Lab 4:
