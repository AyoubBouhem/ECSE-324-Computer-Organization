# ECSE-324
This repositories contains the code written for the labs of the class ECSE 324 - Computer Organization at McGill University, Winter 2018. The lab were completed with ARM assembly subroutines and C programs.

All labs were completed with the use of Quartus 16.1 and Intel FPGA monitor program on an Altera DE1-SoC single board computer.

Lab 1:
This lab required us to implement bubble sort in assembly.

Lab 2:
The first part of this lab required us to implement a way to computer a fibonacci sequence recursively using assembly and the second part of this lab taught us to call assembly subroutine from a C program.
